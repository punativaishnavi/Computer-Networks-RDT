# Computer-Networks-RDT
Implementing rdt3.0, the final version of the stop-and-wait approach. rdt3.0 can handle bit errors and packet loss. In this project, will be implementing the services on both the sender and receiver ends. This rdt3.0 runs in the application layer, and  can choose either TCP or UDP as the underlying transport service.
